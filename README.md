https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/gif-toolkit-powered-by-tenor-173993

This asset uses scripts and images that are governed under the Tenor API Terms of Service; see Third-Party Notices.txt file in package for details.

NOTE: This plugin is not a GIF decoder, it does not support .gif file formats.
This is a plugin that communicates with TenorAPI and grabs the .MP4 version.

Description
With GIF Toolkit you can make search requests to the Tenor API, then display them in-game using Unity's Video Player component.

Features
● Search any GIF on Tenor
● Get GIF by specific ID - Pinical for an online chat system that supports GIFs
● Filter search results by Content Rating - G, PG, PG-13, and R(No Nudity)
● Select from different qualities Nano, Tiny and Normal
● Get the GIF's thumbnail, title, size, etc
● Play Tenor GIFs with sound on supported GIFs

Benefits
● This toolkit is UI safe. You can make API calls without holing up the Update thread
● GIFs are played through .mp4 file format, vastly superior in quality and data size.
In some cases .mp4 is half the size of a .gif file
● It comes with an example scene and code that's got everything you need to get working straight from get-go!
